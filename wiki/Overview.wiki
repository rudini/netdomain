= Introduction =

netdomain supports developer in creating flexible data access layers according to Domain-Driven Design pattern.

The main features of netdomain are:
  * Simplifies the using of persistence frameworks (ORM)
  * Enables and simplifies Test Driven Development
  * Supports LINQ to SQL, ADO .Net Entity Framework 4.0 and NHibernate
  * Expandable by any data source supporting Linq
  * Enhances missing functionalities to LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework
  * Supports high performance mass data update processing

= Simplifies the using of persistence frameworks (ORM) =

The business logic just works against an interfaced called IWorkspace for fetching, deleting and updating entities. LINQ is the common language for querying data.
The persistence framework you use doesn't matter any longer.

Here's a code sample of a small unit of work implementation:

{{{
using (ObjectContext ctx = new MyObjectContext())
using (IWorkspace ws = new LinqToEntitiesWorkspace(ctx))
{
  var person = ws.CreateQuery<Person>().Where(p => p.Id == id).Single();
  person.Name = "changedName";
  ws.SubmitChanges();
}
}}}
