= Repository pattern =

The concept is to let your Repositories only talk to the Workspace abstraction. For common repository functions, a base class is implemented.

The following sample shows, how to create a Repository class in your code.
Your class must only derive from the Repository base class of a specific type (the aggregate root type).
The Repository gets the IWorkspace by its constructor.

{{{
public class PersonRepository : Repository<Person>
{
    public PersonRepository(IWorkspace context)
        : base(context)
    { }
}
}}}
